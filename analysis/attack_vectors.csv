CVE-2023-5363,"Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
initialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncation
or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.

Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.

When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or
EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,
via the ""keylen"" parameter or the IV length, via the ""ivlen"" parameter,
within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
causing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers
and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.

For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
loss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D
section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.

Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
critical.

Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation
and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being
vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then
this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
issue as Moderate severity overall.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

CVE-2023-5678,"Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking
excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to
generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays.  Likewise, applications
that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),
DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore
vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.

Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large
P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.

An application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and
supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of
other OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other

Projects still using RobotsAndPencils/go-saml should move to another SAML library or alternatively remove support for SAML from their projects.

CVE-2024-27308,"Mio is a Metal I/O library for Rust. When using named pipes on Windows, mio will under some circumstances return invalid tokens that correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered from the mio registry. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how mio is used. For some applications, invalid tokens may be ignored or cause a warning or a crash. On the other hand, for applications that store pointers in the tokens, this vulnerability may result in a use-after-free. For users of Tokio, this vulnerability is serious and can result in a use-after-free in Tokio. The vulnerability is Windows-specific, and can only happen if you are using named pipes. Other IO resources are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in mio v0.8.11. All versions of mio between v0.7.2 and v0.8.10 are vulnerable. Tokio is vulnerable when you are using a vulnerable version of mio AND you are using at least Tokio v1.30.0. Versions of Tokio prior to v1.30.0 will ignore invalid tokens, so they are not vulnerable. Vulnerable libraries that use mio can work around this issue by detecting and ignoring invalid tokens.",unknown

Prior to versions 19.2.16, 20.3.14, and 21.0.1, there is a XSRF token leakage via protocol-relative URLs in angular HTTP clients. The vulnerability is a Credential Leak by App Logic that leads to the unauthorized disclosure of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) token to an attacker-controlled domain. Angular's HttpClient has a built-in XSRF protection mechanism that works by checking if a request URL starts with a protocol (http:// or https://) to determine if it is cross-origin. If the URL starts with protocol-relative URL (//), it is incorrectly treated as a same-origin request, and the XSRF token is automatically added to the X-XSRF-TOKEN header. This issue has been patched in versions 19.2.16, 20.3.14, and 21.0.1. A workaround for this issue involves avoiding using protocol-relative URLs (URLs starting with //) in HttpClient requests.

CVE-2025-12638,"Keras version 3.11.3 is affected by a path traversal vulnerability in the keras.utils.get_file() function when extracting tar archives. The vulnerability arises because the function uses Python's tarfile.extractall() method without the security-critical filter='data' parameter. Although Keras attempts to filter unsafe paths using filter_safe_paths(), this filtering occurs before extraction, and a PATH_MAX symlink resolution bug triggers during extraction. This bug causes symlink resolution to fail due to path length limits, resulting in a security bypass that allows files to be written outside the intended extraction directory. This can lead to arbitrary file writes outside the cache directory, enabling potential system compromise or malicious code execution. The vulnerability affects Keras installations that process tar archives with get_file() and does not affect versions where this extraction method is secured with the appropriate filter parameter.",unknown

From version 5.0 to 5.7, the application contains an input-neutralization flaw in its mail configuration and delivery workflow that allows user-controlled values to flow directly into the system’s sendmail command. Because these values are not sanitized or constrained before being incorporated into the command execution path, certain sendmail behaviors can be unintentionally invoked during email processing. This makes it possible for the application to write files on the server as part of the mail-handling routine, and in deployments where those files end up in web-accessible locations, the behavior can be leveraged to achieve execution of attacker-controlled content. The issue stems entirely from constructing OS-level command strings using unsanitized input within the mail-sending logic. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.",unknown

After obtaining a valid reset link for any account they can receive email for, an attacker can alter the username parameter in the final reset request to target a different user.

As a result, a disabled user, or an attacker using a compromised account, can continue to access protected pages and perform operations as long as a prior session remains active. Because the server performs no session revocation or session-store cleanup during these critical state changes, disabling an account or updating credentials has no effect on already-established sessions. This makes administrative disable actions ineffective and allows unauthorized users to retain full access even after an account is closed or a password is reset, exposing the system to prolonged unauthorized use and significantly increasing the impact of account takeover scenarios.

CVE-2025-59789,"Uncontrolled recursion in the json2pb component in Apache bRPC (version < 1.15.0) on all platforms allows remote attackers to make the server crash via sending deep recursive json data.

Root Cause:
The bRPC json2pb component uses rapidjson to parse json data from the network. The rapidjson parser uses a recursive parsing method by default. If the input json has a large depth of recursive structure, the parser function may run into stack overflow.

Affected Scenarios:
Use bRPC server with protobuf message to serve http+json requests from untrusted network. Or directly use JsonToProtoMessage to convert json from untrusted input.



How to Fix: 
(Choose one of the following options) 
1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.15.0, which fixes this issue.
2. Apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/3099 



Note:
No matter which option 

you choose, you should know that the fix introduces a recursion depth limit with default value 100. It affects these functions: 

ProtoMessageToJson, ProtoMessageToProtoJson, JsonToProtoMessage, and ProtoJsonToProtoMessage.

 If your requests contain json or protobuf messages that have a depth exceeding the limit, the request will be failed after applying the fix. You can modify the gflag json2pb_max_recursion_depth to change the limit.",network

This may lead to unexpected content in packets sent to the server (for example, part of an MQTT topic may leak into the message body in a PUBLISH packet).


The issue arises because the length of the data passed in was converted from an int64/int32 (depending upon CPU) to an int16 without checks for overflows. The int16 length was then written, followed by the data (e.g. topic). This meant that when the data (e.g. topic) was over 65535 bytes then the amount of data written exceeds what the length field indicates. This could lead to a corrupt packet, or mean that the excess data leaks into another field (e.g. topic leaks into message body).",unknown

CVE-2025-13353,"In gokey versions <0.2.0,
 a flaw in the seed decryption logic resulted in passwords incorrectly 
being derived solely from the initial vector and the AES-GCM 
authentication tag of the key seed.


This issue has been fixed in gokey version 0.2.0. This is a breaking change. The fix has invalidated any passwords/secrets that were derived from the seed file (using the -s option). Even if the input seed file stays the same, version 0.2.0 gokey will generate different secrets.


Impact
This vulnerability impacts generated keys/secrets using a seed file as an entropy input (using the -s option). Keys/secrets generated just from the master password (without the -s
 option) are not impacted. The confidentiality of the seed itself is 
also not impacted (it is not required to regenerate the seed itself). 
Specific impact includes:



  *  keys/secrets generated from a seed file may have lower entropy: it 
was expected that the whole seed would be used to generate keys (240 
bytes of entropy input), where in vulnerable versions only 28 bytes was 
used

  *  a malicious entity could have recovered all passwords, generated 
from a particular seed, having only the seed file in possession without 
the knowledge of the seed master password




Patches
The code logic bug has been fixed in gokey version 0.2.0
 and above. Due to the deterministic nature of gokey, fixed versions 
will produce different passwords/secrets using seed files, as all seed 
entropy will be used now.


System secret rotation guidance
It is advised for users to regenerate passwords/secrets using the patched version of gokey (0.2.0
 and above), and provision/rotate these secrets into respective systems 
in place of the old secret. A specific rotation procedure is 
system-dependent, but most common patterns are described below.


Systems that do not require the old password/secret for rotation
Such systems usually have a ""Forgot password"" facility or a
 similar facility allowing users to rotate their password/secrets by 
sending a unique ""magic"" link to the user's email or phone. In such 
cases users are advised to use this facility and input the newly 
generated password secret, when prompted by the system.


Systems that require the old password/secret for rotation
Such systems usually have a modal password rotation window
 usually in the user settings section requiring the user to input the 
old and the new password sometimes with a confirmation. To 
generate/recover the old password in such cases users are advised to:



  *  temporarily download  gokey version 0.1.3 https://github.com/cloudflare/gokey/releases/tag/v0.1.3  for their respective operating system to recover the old password

  *  use gokey version 0.2.0 or above to generate the new password

  *  populate the system provided password rotation form




Systems that allow multiple credentials for the same account to be provisioned
Such systems usually require a secret or a cryptographic 
key as a credential for access, but allow several credentials at the 
same time. One example is SSH: a particular user may have several 
authorized public keys configured on the SSH server for access. For such
 systems users are advised to:



  *  generate a new secret/key/credential using gokey version 0.2.0 or above

  *  provision the new secret/key/credential in addition to the existing credential on the system

  *  verify that the access or required system operation is still possible with the new secret/key/credential

  *  revoke authorization for the existing/old credential from the system

CVE-2025-40214,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Initialise scc_index in unix_add_edge().

Quang Le reported that the AF_UNIX GC could garbage-collect a
receive queue of an alive in-flight socket, with a nice repro.

The repro consists of three stages.

  1)
    1-a. Create a single cyclic reference with many sockets
    1-b. close() all sockets
    1-c. Trigger GC

  2)
    2-a. Pass sk-A to an embryo sk-B
    2-b. Pass sk-X to sk-X
    2-c. Trigger GC

  3)
    3-a. accept() the embryo sk-B
    3-b. Pass sk-B to sk-C
    3-c. close() the in-flight sk-A
    3-d. Trigger GC

As of 2-c, sk-A and sk-X are linked to unix_unvisited_vertices,
and unix_walk_scc() groups them into two different SCCs:

  unix_sk(sk-A)->vertex->scc_index = 2 (UNIX_VERTEX_INDEX_START)
  unix_sk(sk-X)->vertex->scc_index = 3

Once GC completes, unix_graph_grouped is set to true.
Also, unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is set to true due to sk-X's
cyclic self-reference, which makes close() trigger GC.

At 3-b, unix_add_edge() allocates unix_sk(sk-B)->vertex and
links it to unix_unvisited_vertices.

unix_update_graph() is called at 3-a. and 3-b., but neither
unix_graph_grouped nor unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is changed
because both sk-B's listener and sk-C are not in-flight.

3-c decrements sk-A's file refcnt to 1.

Since unix_graph_grouped is true at 3-d, unix_walk_scc_fast()
is finally called and iterates 3 sockets sk-A, sk-B, and sk-X:

  sk-A -> sk-B (-> sk-C)
  sk-X -> sk-X

This is totally fine.  All of them are not yet close()d and
should be grouped into different SCCs.

However, unix_vertex_dead() misjudges that sk-A and sk-B are
in the same SCC and sk-A is dead.

  unix_sk(sk-A)->scc_index == unix_sk(sk-B)->scc_index <-- Wrong!
  &&
  sk-A's file refcnt == unix_sk(sk-A)->vertex->out_degree
                                       ^-- 1 in-flight count for sk-B
  -> sk-A is dead !?

The problem is that unix_add_edge() does not initialise scc_index.

Stage 1) is used for heap spraying, making a newly allocated
vertex have vertex->scc_index == 2 (UNIX_VERTEX_INDEX_START)
set by unix_walk_scc() at 1-c.

Let's track the max SCC index from the previous unix_walk_scc()
call and assign the max + 1 to a new vertex's scc_index.

This way, we can continue to avoid Tarjan's algorithm while
preventing misjudgments.",unknown
CVE-2025-40215,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x

The ipcomp fallback tunnels currently get deleted (from the various
lists and hashtables) as the last user state that needed that fallback
is destroyed (not deleted). If a reference to that user state still
exists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,
triggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining
references, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 (""xfrm: destroy xfrm_state
synchronously on net exit path"") is not complete.

We recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of
skbs (commit 9b6412e6979f (""tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we
currently drop dst"")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs
with a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns
destruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the
time xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)
xfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding
fallback state.

Instead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,
this patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the
fallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been
deleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is
dropped.

A separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since
we're going to lock x->tunnel while x is locked.",unknown

callback function with ACTION_AGAIN.

pte_offset_map_lock() can continuously fail if the target is a pmd
migration entry, though.  Hence it could cause an infinite page table walk
if the migration cannot be done until the page table walk is finished. 
This indeed caused a soft lockup when CPU hotplugging and DAMON were

CVE-2025-40219,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/IOV: Add PCI rescan-remove locking when enabling/disabling SR-IOV

Before disabling SR-IOV via config space accesses to the parent PF,
sriov_disable() first removes the PCI devices representing the VFs.

Since commit 9d16947b7583 (""PCI: Add global pci_lock_rescan_remove()"")
such removal operations are serialized against concurrent remove and
rescan using the pci_rescan_remove_lock. No such locking was ever added
in sriov_disable() however. In particular when commit 18f9e9d150fc
(""PCI/IOV: Factor out sriov_add_vfs()"") factored out the PCI device
removal into sriov_del_vfs() there was still no locking around the
pci_iov_remove_virtfn() calls.

On s390 the lack of serialization in sriov_disable() may cause double
remove and list corruption with the below (amended) trace being observed:

This is because in addition to sriov_disable() removing the VFs, the
platform also generates hot-unplug events for the VFs. This being the
reverse operation to the hotplug events generated by sriov_enable() and
handled via pdev->no_vf_scan. And while the event processing takes
pci_rescan_remove_lock and checks whether the struct pci_dev still exists,
the lack of synchronization makes this checking racy.

Other races may also be possible of course though given that this lack of
locking persisted so long observable races seem very rare. Even on s390 the
list corruption was only observed with certain devices since the platform
events are only triggered by config accesses after the removal, so as long
as the removal finished synchronously they would not race. Either way the
locking is missing so fix this by adding it to the sriov_del_vfs() helper.

Just like PCI rescan-remove, locking is also missing in sriov_add_vfs()
including for the error case where pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is
called without the PCI rescan-remove lock being held. Even in the non-error
case, adding new PCI devices and buses should be serialized via the PCI
rescan-remove lock. Add the necessary locking.",unknown
CVE-2025-40220,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers

I observed a hang when running generic/323 against a fuseblk server.
This test opens a file, initiates a lot of AIO writes to that file
descriptor, and closes the file descriptor before the writes complete.
Unsurprisingly, the AIO exerciser threads are mostly stuck waiting for
responses from the fuseblk server:

But the /weird/ part is that the fuseblk server threads are waiting for
responses from itself:

# cat /proc/372210/task/372232/stack
[<0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]

The fuseblk server is fuse2fs so there's nothing all that exciting in
the server itself.  So why is the fuse server calling fuse_file_put?
The commit message for the fstest sheds some light on that:

""By closing the file descriptor before calling io_destroy, you pretty
much guarantee that the last put on the ioctx will be done in interrupt
context (during I/O completion).

Aha.  AIO fgets a new struct file from the fd when it queues the ioctx.
The completion of the FUSE_WRITE command from userspace causes the fuse
server to call the AIO completion function.  The completion puts the
struct file, queuing a delayed fput to the fuse server task.  When the
fuse server task returns to userspace, it has to run the delayed fput,
which in the case of a fuseblk server, it does synchronously.

Sending the FUSE_RELEASE command sychronously from fuse server threads
is a bad idea because a client program can initiate enough simultaneous
AIOs such that all the fuse server threads end up in delayed_fput, and
now there aren't any threads left to handle the queued fuse commands.

Fix this by only using asynchronous fputs when closing files, and leave
a comment explaining why.",unknown

CVE-2025-40222,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: sh-sci: fix RSCI FIFO overrun handling

The receive error handling code is shared between RSCI and all other
SCIF port types, but the RSCI overrun_reg is specified as a memory
offset, while for other SCIF types it is an enum value used to index
into the sci_port_params->regs array, as mentioned above the
sci_serial_in() function.

For RSCI, the overrun_reg is CSR (0x48), causing the sci_getreg() call
inside the sci_handle_fifo_overrun() function to index outside the
bounds of the regs array, which currently has a size of 20, as specified
by SCI_NR_REGS.

Because of this, we end up accessing memory outside of RSCI's
rsci_port_params structure, which, when interpreted as a plat_sci_reg,
happens to have a non-zero size, causing the following WARN when
sci_serial_in() is called, as the accidental size does not match the
supported register sizes.

The existence of the overrun_reg needs to be checked because
SCIx_SH3_SCIF_REGTYPE has overrun_reg set to SCLSR, but SCLSR is not
present in the regs array.

Avoid calling sci_getreg() for port types which don't use standard
register handling.

Use the ops->read_reg() and ops->write_reg() functions to properly read
and write registers for RSCI, and change the type of the status variable
to accommodate the 32-bit CSR register.

sci_getreg() and sci_serial_in() are also called with overrun_reg in the
sci_mpxed_interrupt() interrupt handler, but that code path is not used
for RSCI, as it does not have a muxed interrupt.

CVE-2025-40223,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

most: usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect

hdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which eventually
unregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface->dev).
If that drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev()
immediately while hdm_disconnect() is still executing.

The old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in
hdm_disconnect() and then performed additional put_device() calls.
Depending on refcount order, this could lead to use-after-free or
double-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also
performed puts).

Fix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(),
so they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by
dropping the extra put_device() calls in hdm_disconnect() that are
redundant after device_unregister() and most_deregister_interface().

This addresses the KASAN slab-use-after-free reported by syzbot in

mm: prevent poison consumption when splitting THP

When performing memory error injection on a THP (Transparent Huge Page)
mapped to userspace on an x86 server, the kernel panics with the following
trace.  The expected behavior is to terminate the affected process instead
of panicking the kernel, as the x86 Machine Check code can recover from an
in-userspace #MC.

  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 3: bd80000000070134

  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine check

The root cause of this panic is that handling a memory failure triggered
by an in-userspace #MC necessitates splitting the THP.  The splitting
process employs a mechanism, implemented in
try_to_map_unused_to_zeropage(), which reads the pages in the THP to
identify zero-filled pages.  However, reading the pages in the THP results
in a second in-kernel #MC, occurring before the initial memory_failure()
completes, ultimately leading to a kernel panic.  See the kernel panic
call trace on the two #MCs.

                          Kernel panic

[1] Triggered by accessing a hardware-poisoned THP in userspace, which is
    typically recoverable by terminating the affected process.

[2] Call folio_set_has_hwpoisoned() before try_to_split_thp_page().

[3] Pass the RMP_USE_SHARED_ZEROPAGE remap flag to remap_page().

[4] Try to map the unused THP to zeropage.

[5] Re-access pages in the hw-poisoned THP in the kernel.

[6] Triggered in-kernel, leading to a panic kernel.

In Step[2], memory_failure() sets the poisoned flag on the page in the THP
by TestSetPageHWPoison() before calling try_to_split_thp_page().

As suggested by David Hildenbrand, fix this panic by not accessing to the
poisoned page in the THP during zeropage identification, while continuing
to scan unaffected pages in the THP for possible zeropage mapping.  This
prevents a second in-kernel #MC that would cause kernel panic in Step[4].

vsock: fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()

Syzbot reported a potential lock inversion deadlock between
vsock_register_mutex and sk_lock-AF_VSOCK when vsock_linger() is called.

The issue was introduced by commit 687aa0c5581b (""vsock: Fix
transport_* TOCTOU"") which added vsock_register_mutex locking in
vsock_assign_transport() around the transport->release() call, that can
call vsock_linger(). vsock_assign_transport() can be called with sk_lock
held. vsock_linger() calls sk_wait_event() that temporarily releases and
re-acquires sk_lock. During this window, if another thread hold
vsock_register_mutex while trying to acquire sk_lock, a circular
dependency is created.

Fix this by releasing vsock_register_mutex before calling
transport->release() and vsock_deassign_transport(). This is safe
because we don't need to hold vsock_register_mutex while releasing the
old transport, and we ensure the new transport won't disappear by

IOW ovl_check_encode_origin derefs inode->i_sb->s_root, after it was set
to NULL in the unmount path.

Fix it by protecting calling exportfs_encode_fid() from
show_mark_fhandle() with s_umount lock.

This form of fix was suggested by Amir in [1].

CVE-2025-40238,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix IPsec cleanup over MPV device

When we do mlx5e_detach_netdev() we eventually disable blocking events
notifier, among those events are IPsec MPV events from IB to core.

So before disabling those blocking events, make sure to also unregister
the devcom device and mark all this device operations as complete,
in order to prevent the other device from using invalid netdev
during future devcom events which could cause the trace below.

net: phy: micrel: always set shared->phydev for LAN8814

Currently, during the LAN8814 PTP probe shared->phydev is only set if PTP

This is an issue as shared->phydev is unconditionally being used when IRQ

not set it will cause a NULL pointer exception and crash the kernel.

So, simply always set shared->phydev to avoid the NULL pointer exception.",unknown

The HFS_SB(sb)->bitmap buffer is allocated in hfs_mdb_get():

HFS_SB(sb)->bitmap = kmalloc(8192, GFP_KERNEL);

Finally, it can trigger the reported issue because kmalloc()
doesn't clear the allocated memory. If allocated memory contains
only zeros, then everything will work pretty fine.
But if the allocated memory contains the ""garbage"", then
it can affect the bitmap operations and it triggers
the reported issue.

This patch simply exchanges the kmalloc() on kzalloc()
with the goal to guarantee the correctness of bitmap operations.
Because, newly created allocation bitmap should have all
available blocks free. Potentially, initialization bitmap's read
operation could not fill the whole allocated memory and
""garbage"" in the not initialized memory will be the reason of
volume coruptions and file system driver bugs.",unknown

CVE-2025-40245,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nios2: ensure that memblock.current_limit is set when setting pfn limits

On nios2, with CONFIG_FLATMEM set, the kernel relies on
memblock_get_current_limit() to determine the limits of mem_map, in
particular for max_low_pfn.
Unfortunately, memblock.current_limit is only default initialized to
MEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ANYWHERE at this point of the bootup, potentially leading
to situations where max_low_pfn can erroneously exceed the value of
max_pfn and, thus, the valid range of available DRAM.

This can in turn cause kernel-level paging failures, e.g.:

[   76.900000] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 20303000
[   76.900000] ea = c0080890, ra = c000462c, cause = 14
[   76.900000] Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops
[   76.900000] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops ]---

This patch fixes this by pre-calculating memblock.current_limit
based on the upper limits of the available memory ranges via
adjust_lowmem_bounds, a simplified version of the equivalent
implementation within the arm architecture.",unknown

 ==================================================================

On further analysis, I realized that the second parameter to min() is
not correct.  xfs_ifork::if_bytes is the size of the xfs_ifork::if_data
buffer.  if_bytes can be smaller than the data fork size because:

(a) the forkoff code tries to keep the data area as large as possible
(b) for symbolic links, if_bytes is the ondisk file size + 1
(c) forkoff is always a multiple of 8.

Case in point: for a single-byte symlink target, forkoff will be
8 but the buffer will only be 2 bytes long.

In other words, the logic here is wrong and we walk off the end of the
incore buffer.  Fix that.",unknown

Since msm_vma_job_free() is called directly from the ioctl, this looks
like an error path cleanup issue.  Which I think results from
prealloc_cleanup() called without a preceding successful
prealloc_allocate() call.  So handle that case better.

CVE-2025-40248,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established

During connect(), acting on a signal/timeout by disconnecting an already
established socket leads to several issues:

1. connect() invoking vsock_transport_cancel_pkt() ->
   virtio_transport_purge_skbs() may race with sendmsg() invoking
   virtio_transport_get_credit(). This results in a permanently elevated
   `vvs->bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.

2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket
   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap
   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.

3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -> SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a
   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for
   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a
   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.

Do not disconnect socket on signal/timeout. Keep the logic for unconnected
sockets: they don't linger, can't be placed in a sockmap, are rejected by
sendmsg().

With the final call to fput() on a file descriptor, the release action
may be deferred and scheduled on a work queue. The reference count of
that descriptor is still zero and it must not be used. It's possible
that a GPIO change, we want to notify the user-space about, happens
AFTER the reference count on the file descriptor associated with the

notifier.

Using the regular get_file() routine in this situation triggers the
following warning:

net/mlx5: Clean up only new IRQ glue on request_irq() failure

The mlx5_irq_alloc() function can inadvertently free the entire rmap
and end up in a crash[1] when the other threads tries to access this,
when request_irq() fails due to exhausted IRQ vectors. This commit
modifies the cleanup to remove only the specific IRQ mapping that was
just added.

This prevents removal of other valid mappings and ensures precise
cleanup of the failed IRQ allocation's associated glue object.

CVE-2025-40251,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

devlink: rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy

The function devl_rate_nodes_destroy is documented to ""Unset parent for
all rate objects"". However, it was only calling the driver-specific
`rate_leaf_parent_set` or `rate_node_parent_set` ops and decrementing
the parent's refcount, without actually setting the
`devlink_rate->parent` pointer to NULL.

This leaves a dangling pointer in the `devlink_rate` struct, which cause
refcount error in netdevsim[1] and mlx5[2]. In addition, this is
inconsistent with the behavior of `devlink_nl_rate_parent_node_set`,
where the parent pointer is correctly cleared.

This patch fixes the issue by explicitly setting `devlink_rate->parent`
to NULL after notifying the driver, thus fulfilling the function's
documented behavior for all rate objects.

net: openvswitch: remove never-working support for setting nsh fields

The validation of the set(nsh(...)) action is completely wrong.
It runs through the nsh_key_put_from_nlattr() function that is the
same function that validates NSH keys for the flow match and the
push_nsh() action.  However, the set(nsh(...)) has a very different
memory layout.  Nested attributes in there are doubled in size in
case of the masked set().  That makes proper validation impossible.

There is also confusion in the code between the 'masked' flag, that
says that the nested attributes are doubled in size containing both
the value and the mask, and the 'is_mask' that says that the value
we're parsing is the mask.  This is causing kernel crash on trying to
write into mask part of the match with SW_FLOW_KEY_PUT() during
validation, while validate_nsh() doesn't allocate any memory for it:

The third issue with this process is that while trying to convert
the non-masked set into masked one, validate_set() copies and doubles
the size of the OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH as if it didn't have any nested
attributes.  It should be copying each nested attribute and doubling
them in size independently.  And the process must be properly reversed
during the conversion back from masked to a non-masked variant during
the flow dump.

In the end, the only two outcomes of trying to use this action are
either validation failure or a kernel crash.  And if somehow someone
manages to install a flow with such an action, it will most definitely
not do what it is supposed to, since all the keys and the masks are
mixed up.

Fixing all the issues is a complex task as it requires re-writing
most of the validation code.

Given that and the fact that this functionality never worked since
introduction, let's just remove it altogether.  It's better to
re-introduce it later with a proper implementation instead of trying
to fix it in stable releases.",unknown

CVE-2025-40256,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: also call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel at destroy time for states that were never added

In commit b441cf3f8c4b (""xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x""), I
missed the case where state creation fails between full
initialization (->init_state has been called) and being inserted on
the lists.

In this situation, ->init_state has been called, so for IPcomp
tunnels, the fallback tunnel has been created and added onto the
lists, but the user state never gets added, because we fail before
that. The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we
don't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up
leaking the FB tunnel.

There are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in
both net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,
xfrm_state_migrate). A ""proper"" rollback of the init_state work would
probably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets
more complicated as multiple states may be involved.

At some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call
xfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states
will have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,
which solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)
aimed at. All states (including FB tunnels) will be removed from the
lists once xfrm_state_fini has called flush_work(&xfrm_state_gc_work).",unknown

Prior to 0.27.0, a vulnerability allows attacker-controlled HTTP headers to influence server-visible metadata, logging, and authorization decisions. An attacker can inject headers named REMOTE_ADDR, REMOTE_PORT, LOCAL_ADDR, LOCAL_PORT that are parsed into the request header multimap via read_headers() in httplib.h (headers.emplace), then the server later appends its own internal metadata using the same header names in Server::process_request without erasing duplicates. Because Request::get_header_value returns the first entry for a header key (id == 0) and the client-supplied headers are parsed before server-inserted headers, downstream code that uses these header names may inadvertently use attacker-controlled values. Affected files/locations: cpp-httplib/httplib.h (read_headers, Server::process_request, Request::get_header_value, get_header_value_u64) and cpp-httplib/docker/main.cc (get_client_ip, nginx_access_logger, nginx_error_logger).

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer

The PCM stream data in USB-audio driver is transferred over USB URB
packet buffers, and each packet size is determined dynamically.  The
packet sizes are limited by some factors such as wMaxPacketSize USB
descriptor.  OTOH, in the current code, the actually used packet sizes
are determined only by the rate and the PPS, which may be bigger than
the size limit above.  This results in a buffer overflow, as reported
by syzbot.

Basically when the limit is smaller than the calculated packet size,
it implies that something is wrong, most likely a weird USB
descriptor.  So the best option would be just to return an error at
the parameter setup time before doing any further operations.

This patch introduces such a sanity check, and returns -EINVAL when
the packet size is greater than maxpacksize.  The comparison with
ep->packsize[1] alone should suffice since it's always equal or
greater than ep->packsize[0].",unknown

mm, swap: fix potential UAF issue for VMA readahead

Since commit 78524b05f1a3 (""mm, swap: avoid redundant swap device
pinning""), the common helper for allocating and preparing a folio in the
swap cache layer no longer tries to get a swap device reference
internally, because all callers of __read_swap_cache_async are already
holding a swap entry reference.  The repeated swap device pinning isn't
needed on the same swap device.

Caller of VMA readahead is also holding a reference to the target entry's
swap device, but VMA readahead walks the page table, so it might encounter
swap entries from other devices, and call __read_swap_cache_async on
another device without holding a reference to it.

So it is possible to cause a UAF when swapoff of device A raced with
swapin on device B, and VMA readahead tries to read swap entries from
device A.  It's not easy to trigger, but in theory, it could cause real
issues.

Make VMA readahead try to get the device reference first if the swap
device is a different one from the target entry.",unknown

mm/secretmem: fix use-after-free race in fault handler

When a page fault occurs in a secret memory file created with
`memfd_secret(2)`, the kernel will allocate a new folio for it, mark the
underlying page as not-present in the direct map, and add it to the file
mapping.

If two tasks cause a fault in the same page concurrently, both could end
up allocating a folio and removing the page from the direct map, but only
one would succeed in adding the folio to the file mapping.  The task that
failed undoes the effects of its attempt by (a) freeing the folio again
and (b) putting the page back into the direct map.  However, by doing
these two operations in this order, the page becomes available to the
allocator again before it is placed back in the direct mapping.

If another task attempts to allocate the page between (a) and (b), and the
kernel tries to access it via the direct map, it would result in a
supervisor not-present page fault.

However, in case when the server got an OPEN (which created
a parent stateid), followed by a COPY_NOTIFY using that stateid,
followed by a client reboot. New client instance while doing
CREATE_SESSION would force expire previous state of this client.
It leads to the open state being freed thru release_openowner->

If the parent stateid is freed (without freeing the copynotify

the lifecycle of f_mapping is outside the purview of KVM.  Dereferencing
the mapping is *probably* fine, but there's no need to invalidate anything

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd

In snd_usb_create_streams(), for UAC version 3 devices, the Interface
Association Descriptor (IAD) is retrieved via usb_ifnum_to_if(). If this
call fails, a fallback routine attempts to obtain the IAD from the next
interface and sets a BADD profile. However, snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd()
assumes that the IAD retrieved from usb_ifnum_to_if() is always valid,
without performing a NULL check. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference when usb_ifnum_to_if() fails to find the interface descriptor.

This patch adds a NULL pointer check after calling usb_ifnum_to_if() in
snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd() to prevent the dereference.

drm/amdgpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices

Previously, APU platforms (and other scenarios with uninitialized VRAM managers)
triggered a NULL pointer dereference in `ttm_resource_manager_usage()`. The root
cause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,
but that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains
uninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully
set up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to
acquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`, leading to
a kernel OOPS.

1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth control check in
   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for
   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized
   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific
   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.

2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info
   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real VRAM
   usage; otherwise, return 0. This avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is
   NULL.

3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)
   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity: if the
   manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage; otherwise, set
   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).

This approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it:
- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs),
- Aligns with TTM's design by using its native helper function,
- Preserves correct behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized
  `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).

This situation can happen for block devices because when
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is enabled, the maximum logical_block_size
is 64 KiB. set_init_blocksize() then sets the block device
inode->i_blkbits to 13, which is within this limit.

File I/O does not trigger this problem because for filesystems that do
not support the FS_LBS feature, sb_set_blocksize() prevents
sb->s_blocksize_bits from being larger than PAGE_SHIFT. During inode
allocation, alloc_inode()->inode_init_always() assigns inode->i_blkbits
from sb->s_blocksize_bits. Currently, only xfs_fs_type has the FS_LBS
flag, and since xfs I/O paths do not reach submit_bh_wbc(), it does not
hit the left-shift underflow issue.

net: bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass

syzbot reported[1] a use-after-free when deleting an expired fdb. It is
due to a race condition between learning still happening and a port being
deleted, after all its fdbs have been flushed. The port's state has been
toggled to disabled so no learning should happen at that time, but if we
have MST enabled, it will bypass the port's state, that together with VLAN
filtering disabled can lead to fdb learning at a time when it shouldn't
happen while the port is being deleted. VLAN filtering must be disabled
because we flush the port VLANs when it's being deleted which will stop
learning. This fix adds a check for the port's vlan group which is
initialized to NULL when the port is getting deleted, that avoids the port
state bypass. When MST is enabled there would be a minimal new overhead
in the fast-path because the port's vlan group pointer is cache-hot.

btrfs: ensure no dirty metadata is written back for an fs with errors

[BUG]
During development of a minor feature (make sure all btrfs_bio::end_io()
is called in task context), I noticed a crash in generic/388, where
metadata writes triggered new works after btrfs_stop_all_workers().

It turns out that it can even happen without any code modification, just
using RAID5 for metadata and the same workload from generic/388 is going
to trigger the use-after-free.

[CAUSE]
If btrfs hits an error, the fs is marked as error, no new
transaction is allowed thus metadata is in a frozen state.

But there are some metadata modifications before that error, and they are
still in the btree inode page cache.

Since there will be no real transaction commit, all those dirty folios
are just kept as is in the page cache, and they can not be invalidated
by invalidate_inode_pages2() call inside close_ctree(), because they are
dirty.

And finally after btrfs_stop_all_workers(), we call iput() on btree
inode, which triggers writeback of those dirty metadata.

And if the fs is using RAID56 metadata, this will trigger RMW and queue
new works into rmw_workers, which is already stopped, causing warning
from queue_work() and use-after-free.

[FIX]
Add a special handling for write_one_eb(), that if the fs is already in
an error state, immediately mark the bbio as failure, instead of really
submitting them.

Then during close_ctree(), iput() will just discard all those dirty
tree blocks without really writing them back, thus no more new jobs for
already stopped-and-freed workqueues.

The extra discard in write_one_eb() also acts as an extra safenet.
E.g. the transaction abort is triggered by some extent/free space
tree corruptions, and since extent/free space tree is already corrupted
some tree blocks may be allocated where they shouldn't be (overwriting
existing tree blocks). In that case writing them back will further
corrupting the fs.",unknown

orangefs: fix xattr related buffer overflow...

Willy Tarreau <w@1wt.eu> forwarded me a message from
Disclosure <disclosure@aisle.com> with the following
warning:

> The helper `xattr_key()` uses the pointer variable in the loop condition
> rather than dereferencing it. As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL
> (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on
> valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging
> the thread.

I easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel
oops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure
sent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based
this patch on.

After xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an
xattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns
a hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs
used hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using
hash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong
hash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a
getattr for the xattr ""security.capability"" every time. Orangefs
negative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the
xattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for
""security.capability"" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were
ever freed.

I changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead
and the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing furniture.",unknown

wifi: brcmfmac: fix crash while sending Action Frames in standalone AP Mode

Currently, whenever there is a need to transmit an Action frame,
the brcmfmac driver always uses the P2P vif to send the ""actframe"" IOVAR to
firmware. The P2P interfaces were available when wpa_supplicant is managing
the wlan interface.

However, the P2P interfaces are not created/initialized when only hostapd
is managing the wlan interface. And if hostapd receives an ANQP Query REQ
Action frame even from an un-associated STA, the brcmfmac driver tries
to use an uninitialized P2P vif pointer for sending the IOVAR to firmware.
This NULL pointer dereferencing triggers a driver crash.

Fix this, by always using the vif corresponding to the wdev on which the
Action frame Transmission request was initiated by the userspace. This way,
even if P2P vif is not available, the IOVAR is sent to firmware on AP vif
and the ANQP Query RESP Action frame is transmitted without crashing the
driver.

Move init_completion() for ""send_af_done"" from brcmf_p2p_create_p2pdev()
to brcmf_p2p_attach(). Because the former function would not get executed
when only hostapd is managing wlan interface, and it is not safe to do
reinit_completion() later in brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame(), without any prior
init_completion().

And in the brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame() function, the condition check for
P2P Presence response frame is not needed, since the wpa_supplicant is
properly sending the P2P Presense Response frame on the P2P-GO vif instead
of the P2P-Device vif.

NFSD: Define actions for the new time_deleg FATTR4 attributes

NFSv4 clients won't send legitimate GETATTR requests for these new
attributes because they are intended to be used only with CB_GETATTR
and SETATTR. But NFSD has to do something besides crashing if it
ever sees a GETATTR request that queries these attributes.

RFC 8881 Section 18.7.3 states:

> The server MUST return a value for each attribute that the client
> requests if the attribute is supported by the server for the
> target file system. If the server does not support a particular
> attribute on the target file system, then it MUST NOT return the
> attribute value and MUST NOT set the attribute bit in the result
> bitmap. The server MUST return an error if it supports an
> attribute on the target but cannot obtain its value. In that case,
> no attribute values will be returned.

Further, RFC 9754 Section 5 states:

> These new attributes are invalid to be used with GETATTR, VERIFY,
> and NVERIFY, and they can only be used with CB_GETATTR and SETATTR
> by a client holding an appropriate delegation.

Thus there does not appear to be a specific server response mandated

It's common to use mfd core to create child device for the regulator.
In order to do the DT lookup for init data, the child that registered
the regulator would pass its parent as the parameter. And this causes
init data resource allocated to its parent, not itself. The issue happen
when parent device is going to release and regulator core is still doing
some operation of init data constraint for the regulator of child device.

serial: amba-pl011: avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register

Chapter ""B Generic UART"" in ""ARM Server Base System Architecture"" [1]
documentation describes a generic UART interface. Such generic UART
does not support DMA. In current code, sbsa_uart_pops and
amba_pl011_pops share the same stop_rx operation, which will invoke
pl011_dma_rx_stop, leading to an access of the DMACR register. This
commit adds a using_rx_dma check in pl011_dma_rx_stop to avoid the
access to DMACR register for SBSA UARTs which does not support DMA.

When the kernel enables DMA engine with ""CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y"", Linux
SBSA PL011 driver will access PL011 DMACR register in some functions.
For most real SBSA Pl011 hardware implementations, the DMACR write
behaviour will be ignored. So these DMACR operations will not cause
obvious problems. But for some virtual SBSA PL011 hardware, like Xen
virtual SBSA PL011 (vpl011) device, the behaviour might be different.
Xen vpl011 emulation will inject a data abort to guest, when guest is
accessing an unimplemented UART register. As Xen VPL011 is SBSA
compatible, it will not implement DMACR register. So when Linux SBSA
PL011 driver access DMACR register, it will get an unhandled data abort
fault and the application will get a segmentation fault:

CVE-2022-50626,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-usb: fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()

Syzbot reports a memory leak in ""dvb_usb_adapter_init()"".
The leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's
adapter->priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs,
it will exit before incrementing ""num_adapters_initalized"",
which is used as a reference counter to free all adap->priv
in ""dvb_usb_adapter_exit()"". There are multiple error paths that
can exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the
error handling paths for ""dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()"",
""dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()"" and ""dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()""
within ""dvb_usb_adapter_init()"".

This means that in case of an error in any of these functions the
current iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's
adap->priv is not freed.

Fix this by freeing the current iteration's adap->priv in the
""stream_init_err:"" label in the error path. The rest of the
(accounted for) adap->priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit()
as expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.

CVE-2022-50627,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix monitor mode bringup crash

When the interface is brought up in monitor mode, it leads
to NULL pointer dereference crash. This crash happens when
the packet type is extracted for a SKB. This extraction
which is present in the received msdu delivery path,is
not needed for the monitor ring packets since they are
all RAW packets. Hence appending the flags with
""RX_FLAG_ONLY_MONITOR"" to skip that extraction.

The reason for this is that on certain arm64 configuration since
e35123d83ee3 (""arm64: lto: Strengthen READ_ONCE() to acquire when
CONFIG_LTO=y""), READ_ONCE() may be promoted to a full atomic acquire
instruction which cannot be used on unaligned addresses.

Fix it by avoiding READ_ONCE() in read_instrumented_memory(), and simply
forcing the compiler to do the required access by casting to the
appropriate volatile type. In terms of generated code this currently
only affects architectures that do not use the default READ_ONCE()
implementation.

The only downside is that we are not guaranteed atomicity of the access
itself, although on most architectures a plain load up to machine word
size should still be atomic (a fact the default READ_ONCE() still relies
on itself).",unknown

x86: fix clear_user_rep_good() exception handling annotation

This code no longer exists in mainline, because it was removed in
commit d2c95f9d6802 (""x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory
clearing"") upstream.

However, rather than backport the full range of x86 memory clearing and
copying cleanups, fix the exception table annotation placement for the
final 'rep movsb' in clear_user_rep_good(): rather than pointing at the
actual instruction that did the user space access, it pointed to the
register move just before it.

That made sense from a code flow standpoint, but not from an actual
usage standpoint: it means that if user access takes an exception, the
exception handler won't actually find the instruction in the exception
tables.

As a result, rather than fixing it up and returning -EFAULT, it would
then turn it into a kernel oops report instead, something like:

net: deal with integer overflows in kmalloc_reserve()

Blamed commit changed:
    ptr = kmalloc(size);
    if (ptr)
      size = ksize(ptr);

    size = kmalloc_size_roundup(size);
    ptr = kmalloc(size);

This allowed various crash as reported by syzbot [1]
and Kyle Zeng.

Problem is that if @size is bigger than 0x80000001,
kmalloc_size_roundup(size) returns 2^32.

kmalloc_reserve() uses a 32bit variable (obj_size),
so 2^32 is truncated to 0.

kmalloc(0) returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR which is not handled by
skb allocations.

Following trace can be triggered if a netdev->mtu is set
close to 0x7fffffff

We might in the future limit netdev->mtu to more sensible
limit (like KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE).

This patch is based on a syzbot report, and also a report
and tentative fix from Kyle Zeng.

KVM: VMX: Fix crash due to uninitialized current_vmcs

KVM enables 'Enlightened VMCS' and 'Enlightened MSR Bitmap' when running as
a nested hypervisor on top of Hyper-V. When MSR bitmap is updated,
evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark
that the msr bitmap was changed.

vmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr
-> vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The
function checks for current_vmcs if it is null but the check is
insufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized. Because of this, the
code might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs value
left by another task. Preemption is not disabled, the current task can be
preempted and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple
times from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() which leads to crash.

The manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01 so the
solution is to use vmx->vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.

CVE-2023-53768,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers

When allocating the 2D array for handling IRQ type registers in
regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode(), the intent is to allocate a matrix
with num_config_bases rows and num_config_regs columns.

This is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for
each row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to
allocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for
each row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row
(i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this
allocation num_config_regs number of times.

This scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs
is greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating
condition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register
configuration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.

CVE-2025-42615,"In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup did not track or limit failed
 One-Time Password (OTP) attempts during Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
 verification. An attacker who already knew or guessed a valid username 
and password could submit an arbitrary number of OTP codes without 
causing the account to be locked or generating any specific alert for 
administrators.


This lack of rate-limiting and lockout on OTP failures significantly 
lowers the cost of online brute-force attacks against 2FA codes and 
increases the risk of successful account takeover, especially if OTP 
entropy is reduced (e.g. short numeric codes, user reuse, or predictable
 tokens). Additionally, administrators had no direct visibility into 
accounts experiencing repeated 2FA failures, making targeted attacks 
harder to detect and investigate.


The patch introduces a persistent failed_otp_attempts counter on user 
accounts, locks the user after 5 invalid OTP submissions, resets the 
counter on successful verification, and surfaces failed 2FA attempts in 
the admin user list. This enforces an account lockout policy for OTP 
brute-force attempts and improves monitoring capabilities for suspicious

 an attacker who tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious

When Bref prior to version 2.1.17 is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the parsing process, the `Content-Type` header of each part is read using the `Riverline/multipart-parser` library.

The library, in the `StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs slow multi-byte string operations on the header value.
Precisely, the `mb_convert_encoding` function is used with the first (`$string`) and third (`$from_encoding`) parameters read from the header value.

An attacker could send specifically crafted requests which would force the server into performing long operations with a consequent long billed duration.

The attack has the following requirements and limitations: The Lambda should use the Event-Driven Function runtime and the `RequestHandlerInterface` handler and should implement at least an endpoint accepting POST requests; the attacker can send requests up to 6MB long (this is enough to cause a billed duration between 400ms and 500ms with the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref); and if the Lambda uses a PHP runtime <= php-82, the impact is higher as the billed duration in the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref could be brought to more than 900ms for each request.

block: fix race between set_blocksize and read paths

With the new large sector size support, it's now the case that
set_blocksize can change i_blksize and the folio order in a manner that
conflicts with a concurrent reader and causes a kernel crash.

Specifically, let's say that udev-worker calls libblkid to detect the
labels on a block device.  The read call can create an order-0 folio to
read the first 4096 bytes from the disk.  But then udev is preempted.

Next, someone tries to mount an 8k-sectorsize filesystem from the same
block device.  The filesystem calls set_blksize, which sets i_blksize to
8192 and the minimum folio order to 1.

Now udev resumes, still holding the order-0 folio it allocated.  It then
tries to schedule a read bio and do_mpage_readahead tries to create
bufferheads for the folio.  Unfortunately, blocks_per_folio == 0 because
the page size is 4096 but the blocksize is 8192 so no bufferheads are
attached and the bh walk never sets bdev.  We then submit the bio with a
NULL block device and crash.

Therefore, truncate the page cache after flushing but before updating
i_blksize.  However, that's not enough -- we also need to lock out file
IO and page faults during the update.  Take both the i_rwsem and the
invalidate_lock in exclusive mode for invalidations, and in shared mode
for read/write operations.

bpf, x86: fix freeing of not-finalized bpf_prog_pack

syzbot reported a few issues with bpf_prog_pack [1], [2]. This only happens
with multiple subprogs. In jit_subprogs(), we first call bpf_int_jit_compile()
on each sub program. And then, we call it on each sub program again. jit_data
is not freed in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile(). Similarly we don't
call bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile().

If bpf_int_jit_compile() failed for one sub program, we will call
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() for this sub program. However, we don't have a
chance to call it for other sub programs. Then we will hit ""goto out_free"" in
jit_subprogs(), and call bpf_jit_free on some subprograms that haven't got
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() yet.

At this point, bpf_jit_binary_pack_free() is called and the whole 2MB page is
freed erroneously.

Fix this with a custom bpf_jit_free() for x86_64, which calls
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() if necessary. Also, with custom
bpf_jit_free(), bpf_prog_aux->use_bpf_prog_pack is not needed any more,
remove it.

mm: fix zswap writeback race condition

The zswap writeback mechanism can cause a race condition resulting in
memory corruption, where a swapped out page gets swapped in with data that
was written to a different page.

The race unfolds like this:
1. a page with data A and swap offset X is stored in zswap
2. page A is removed off the LRU by zpool driver for writeback in
   zswap-shrink work, data for A is mapped by zpool driver
3. user space program faults and invalidates page entry A, offset X is
   considered free
4. kswapd stores page B at offset X in zswap (zswap could also be
   full, if so, page B would then be IOed to X, then skip step 5.)
5. entry A is replaced by B in tree->rbroot, this doesn't affect the
   local reference held by zswap-shrink work
6. zswap-shrink work writes back A at X, and frees zswap entry A
7. swapin of slot X brings A in memory instead of B

The fix:
Once the swap page cache has been allocated (case ZSWAP_SWAPCACHE_NEW),
zswap-shrink work just checks that the local zswap_entry reference is
still the same as the one in the tree.  If it's not the same it means that
it's either been invalidated or replaced, in both cases the writeback is
aborted because the local entry contains stale data.

Reproducer:
I originally found this by running `stress` overnight to validate my work
on the zswap writeback mechanism, it manifested after hours on my test
machine.  The key to make it happen is having zswap writebacks, so
whatever setup pumps /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages should do
the trick.

In order to reproduce this faster on a vm, I setup a system with ~100M of
available memory and a 500M swap file, then running `stress --vm 1
--vm-bytes 300000000 --vm-stride 4000` makes it happen in matter of tens
of minutes.  One can speed things up even more by swinging

btrfs: exit gracefully if reloc roots don't match

[BUG]
Syzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT() got triggered inside
prepare_to_merge().

[CAUSE]
The root cause of the triggered ASSERT() is we can have a race between
quota tree creation and relocation.

This leads us to create a duplicated quota tree in the
btrfs_read_fs_root() path, and since it's treated as fs tree, it would
have ROOT_SHAREABLE flag, causing us to create a reloc tree for it.

The bug itself is fixed by a dedicated patch for it, but this already
taught us the ASSERT() is not something straightforward for
developers.

[ENHANCEMENT]
Instead of using an ASSERT(), let's handle it gracefully and output
extra info about the mismatch reloc roots to help debug.

Also with the above ASSERT() removed, we can trigger ASSERT(0)s inside
merge_reloc_roots() later.
Also replace those ASSERT(0)s with WARN_ON()s.",unknown

Unfortunately this reallocation is done prior to writing the new vector
length to the task struct, meaning the allocation is done with the old
vector length and can lead to memory corruption due to an undersized buffer
being used.

Move the update of the vector length before the allocation to ensure that
the new vector length is taken into account.

skbuff: Fix a race between coalescing and releasing SKBs

Commit 1effe8ca4e34 (""skbuff: fix coalescing for page_pool fragment
recycling"") allowed coalescing to proceed with non page pool page and page
pool page when @from is cloned, i.e.

to->pp_recycle    --> false
from->pp_recycle  --> true
skb_cloned(from)  --> true

However, it actually requires skb_cloned(@from) to hold true until
coalescing finishes in this situation. If the other cloned SKB is
released while the merging is in process, from_shinfo->nr_frags will be
set to 0 toward the end of the function, causing the increment of frag
page _refcount to be unexpectedly skipped resulting in inconsistent
reference counts. Later when SKB(@to) is released, it frees the page
directly even though the page pool page is still in use, leading to
use-after-free or double-free errors. So it should be prohibited.

CVE-2023-53187,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix use-after-free of new block group that became unused

If a task creates a new block group and that block group becomes unused
before we finish its creation, at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(),
then when btrfs_mark_bg_unused() is called against the block group, we
assume that the block group is currently in the list of block groups to
reclaim, and we move it out of the list of new block groups and into the
list of unused block groups. This has two consequences:

1) We move it out of the list of new block groups associated to the
   current transaction. So the block group creation is not finished and
   if we attempt to delete the bg because it's unused, we will not find
   the block group item in the extent tree (or the new block group tree),
   its device extent items in the device tree etc, resulting in the
   deletion to fail due to the missing items;

2) We don't increment the reference count on the block group when we
   move it to the list of unused block groups, because we assumed the
   block group was on the list of block groups to reclaim, and in that
   case it already has the correct reference count. However the block
   group was on the list of new block groups, in which case no extra
   reference was taken because it's local to the current task. This
   later results in doing an extra reference count decrement when
   removing the block group from the unused list, eventually leading the
   reference count to 0.

This second case was caught when running generic/297 from fstests, which
produced the following assertion failure and stack trace:

CVE-2023-53188,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: openvswitch: fix race on port output

assume the following setup on a single machine:
1. An openvswitch instance with one bridge and default flows
2. two network namespaces ""server"" and ""client""
3. two ovs interfaces ""server"" and ""client"" on the bridge
4. for each ovs interface a veth pair with a matching name and 32 rx and
   tx queues
5. move the ends of the veth pairs to the respective network namespaces
6. assign ip addresses to each of the veth ends in the namespaces (needs
   to be the same subnet)
7. start some http server on the server network namespace
8. test if a client in the client namespace can reach the http server

when following the actions below the host has a chance of getting a cpu
stuck in a infinite loop:
1. send a large amount of parallel requests to the http server (around
   3000 curls should work)
2. in parallel delete the network namespace (do not delete interfaces or
   stop the server, just kill the namespace)

there is a low chance that this will cause the below kernel cpu stuck
message. If this does not happen just retry.
Below there is also the output of bpftrace for the functions mentioned
in the output.

The series of events happening here is:
1. the network namespace is deleted calling
   `unregister_netdevice_many_notify` somewhere in the process
2. this sets first `NETREG_UNREGISTERING` on both ends of the veth and
   then runs `synchronize_net`
3. it then calls `call_netdevice_notifiers` with `NETDEV_UNREGISTER`
4. this is then handled by `dp_device_event` which calls
   `ovs_netdev_detach_dev` (if a vport is found, which is the case for
   the veth interface attached to ovs)
5. this removes the rx_handlers of the device but does not prevent
   packages to be sent to the device
6. `dp_device_event` then queues the vport deletion to work in
   background as a ovs_lock is needed that we do not hold in the
   unregistration path
7. `unregister_netdevice_many_notify` continues to call
   `netdev_unregister_kobject` which sets `real_num_tx_queues` to 0
8. port deletion continues (but details are not relevant for this issue)
9. at some future point the background task deletes the vport

If after 7. but before 9. a packet is send to the ovs vport (which is
not deleted at this point in time) which forwards it to the
`dev_queue_xmit` flow even though the device is unregistering.
In `skb_tx_hash` (which is called in the `dev_queue_xmit`) path there is
a while loop (if the packet has a rx_queue recorded) that is infinite if
`dev->real_num_tx_queues` is zero.

To prevent this from happening we update `do_output` to handle devices
without carrier the same as if the device is not found (which would
be the code path after 9. is done).

Additionally we now produce a warning in `skb_tx_hash` if we will hit
the infinite loop.

CVE-2023-53192,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vxlan: Fix nexthop hash size

The nexthop code expects a 31 bit hash, such as what is returned by
fib_multipath_hash() and rt6_multipath_hash(). Passing the 32 bit hash
returned by skb_get_hash() can lead to problems related to the fact that
'int hash' is a negative number when the MSB is set.

In the case of hash threshold nexthop groups, nexthop_select_path_hthr()
will disproportionately select the first nexthop group entry. In the case
of resilient nexthop groups, nexthop_select_path_res() may do an out of
bounds access in nh_buckets[], for example:
    hash = -912054133
    num_nh_buckets = 2
    bucket_index = 65535

which leads to the following panic:

raw: Fix NULL deref in raw_get_next().

Dae R. Jeong reported a NULL deref in raw_get_next() [0].

It seems that the repro was running these sequences in parallel so
that one thread was iterating on a socket that was being freed in
another netns.

  unshare(0x40060200)
  r0 = syz_open_procfs(0x0, &(0x7f0000002080)='net/raw\x00')
  socket$inet_icmp_raw(0x2, 0x3, 0x1)
  pread64(r0, &(0x7f0000000000)=""""/10, 0xa, 0x10000000007f)

After commit 0daf07e52709 (""raw: convert raw sockets to RCU""), we
use RCU and hlist_nulls_for_each_entry() to iterate over SOCK_RAW
sockets.  However, we should use spinlock for slow paths to avoid
the NULL deref.

Also, SOCK_RAW does not use SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU, and the slab object
is not reused during iteration in the grace period.  In fact, the
lockless readers do not check the nulls marker with get_nulls_value().
So, SOCK_RAW should use hlist instead of hlist_nulls.

Instead of adding an unnecessary barrier by sk_nulls_for_each_rcu(),
let's convert hlist_nulls to hlist and use sk_for_each_rcu() for
fast paths and sk_for_each() and spinlock for /proc/net/raw.

CVE-2022-50262,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Validate BOOT record_size

When the NTFS BOOT record_size field < 0, it represents a
shift value. However, there is no sanity check on the shift result
and the sbi->record_bits calculation through blksize_bits() assumes
the size always > 256, which could lead to NPD while mounting a
malformed NTFS image.

ext4: don't allow journal inode to have encrypt flag

Mounting a filesystem whose journal inode has the encrypt flag causes a
NULL dereference in fscrypt_limit_io_blocks() when the 'inlinecrypt'
mount option is used.

The problem is that when jbd2_journal_init_inode() calls bmap(), it
eventually finds its way into ext4_iomap_begin(), which calls
fscrypt_limit_io_blocks().  fscrypt_limit_io_blocks() requires that if
the inode is encrypted, then its encryption key must already be set up.
That's not the case here, since the journal inode is never ""opened"" like
a normal file would be.  Hence the crash.

A reproducer is:

    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/vdb
    debugfs -w /dev/vdb -R ""set_inode_field <8> flags 0x80808""
    mount /dev/vdb /mnt -o inlinecrypt

To fix this, make ext4 consider journal inodes with the encrypt flag to
be invalid.  (Note, maybe other flags should be rejected on the journal
inode too.  For now, this is just the minimal fix for the above issue.)

I've marked this as fixing the commit that introduced the call to
fscrypt_limit_io_blocks(), since that's what made an actual crash start
being possible.  But this fix could be applied to any version of ext4

The root cause of the problem is that the comparison order of
""prate_section"" in _rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit() is wrong. The
_rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() is used to compare the first n bytes of the two
strings from tail to head, which causes the problem. In the
_rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit(), it was originally intended to meet
this requirement by carefully designing the comparison order.
For example, ""pregulation"" and ""pbandwidth"" are compared in order of
length from small to large, first is 3 and last is 4. However, the
comparison order of ""prate_section"" dose not obey such order requirement,
therefore when ""prate_section"" is ""HT"", when comparing from tail to head,
it will lead to access out of bounds in _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte(). As
mentioned above, the _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() has the same function as
strcmp(), so just strcmp() is enough.

Fix it by removing _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() and use strcmp() barely.
Although it can be fixed by adjusting the comparison order of
""prate_section"", this may cause the value of ""rate_section"" to not be
from 0 to 5. In addition, commit ""21e4b0726dc6"" not only moved driver
from staging to regular tree, but also added setting txpower limit

CVE-2022-50280,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pnode: terminate at peers of source

The propagate_mnt() function handles mount propagation when creating
mounts and propagates the source mount tree @source_mnt to all
applicable nodes of the destination propagation mount tree headed by
@dest_mnt.

Unfortunately it contains a bug where it fails to terminate at peers of
@source_mnt when looking up copies of the source mount that become
masters for copies of the source mount tree mounted on top of slaves in
the destination propagation tree causing a NULL dereference.

Once the mechanics of the bug are understood it's easy to trigger.
Because of unprivileged user namespaces it is available to unprivileged
users.

While fixing this bug we've gotten confused multiple times due to
unclear terminology or missing concepts. So let's start this with some
clarifications:

* The terms ""master"" or ""peer"" denote a shared mount. A shared mount
  belongs to a peer group.

* A peer group is a set of shared mounts that propagate to each other.
  They are identified by a peer group id. The peer group id is available
  in @shared_mnt->mnt_group_id.
  Shared mounts within the same peer group have the same peer group id.
  The peers in a peer group can be reached via @shared_mnt->mnt_share.

* The terms ""slave mount"" or ""dependent mount"" denote a mount that
  receives propagation from a peer in a peer group. IOW, shared mounts
  may have slave mounts and slave mounts have shared mounts as their
  master. Slave mounts of a given peer in a peer group are listed on
  that peers slave list available at @shared_mnt->mnt_slave_list.

* The term ""master mount"" denotes a mount in a peer group. IOW, it
  denotes a shared mount or a peer mount in a peer group. The term
  ""master mount"" - or ""master"" for short - is mostly used when talking
  in the context of slave mounts that receive propagation from a master
  mount. A master mount of a slave identifies the closest peer group a
  slave mount receives propagation from. The master mount of a slave can
  be identified via @slave_mount->mnt_master. Different slaves may point
  to different masters in the same peer group.

* Multiple peers in a peer group can have non-empty ->mnt_slave_lists.
  Non-empty ->mnt_slave_lists of peers don't intersect. Consequently, to
  ensure all slave mounts of a peer group are visited the
  ->mnt_slave_lists of all peers in a peer group have to be walked.

* Slave mounts point to a peer in the closest peer group they receive
  propagation from via @slave_mnt->mnt_master (see above). Together with
  these peers they form a propagation group (see below). The closest
  peer group can thus be identified through the peer group id
  @slave_mnt->mnt_master->mnt_group_id of the peer/master that a slave
  mount receives propagation from.

* A shared-slave mount is a slave mount to a peer group pg1 while also
  a peer in another peer group pg2. IOW, a peer group may receive
  propagation from another peer group.

  If a peer group pg1 is a slave to another peer group pg2 then all
  peers in peer group pg1 point to the same peer in peer group pg2 via
  ->mnt_master. IOW, all peers in peer group pg1 appear on the same
  ->mnt_slave_list. IOW, they cannot be slaves to different peer groups.

* A pure slave mount is a slave mount that is a slave to a peer group
  but is not a peer in another peer group.

* A propagation group denotes the set of mounts consisting of a single
  peer group pg1 and all slave mounts and shared-slave mounts that point
  to a peer in that peer group via ->mnt_master. IOW, all slave mounts
  such that @slave_mnt->mnt_master->mnt_group_id is equal to
  @shared_mnt->mnt_group_id.

  The concept of a propagation group makes it easier to talk about a
  single propagation level in a propagation tree.

  For example, in propagate_mnt() the immediate peers of @dest_mnt and
  all slaves of @dest_mnt's peer group form a propagation group pr

ext4: fix delayed allocation bug in ext4_clu_mapped for bigalloc + inline

When converting files with inline data to extents, delayed allocations
made on a file system created with both the bigalloc and inline options
can result in invalid extent status cache content, incorrect reserved
cluster counts, kernel memory leaks, and potential kernel panics.

With bigalloc, the code that determines whether a block must be
delayed allocated searches the extent tree to see if that block maps
to a previously allocated cluster.  If not, the block is delayed
allocated, and otherwise, it isn't.  However, if the inline option is
also used, and if the file containing the block is marked as able to
store data inline, there isn't a valid extent tree associated with
the file.  The current code in ext4_clu_mapped() calls
ext4_find_extent() to search the non-existent tree for a previously
allocated cluster anyway, which typically finds nothing, as desired.
However, a side effect of the search can be to cache invalid content
from the non-existent tree (garbage) in the extent status tree,
including bogus entries in the pending reservation tree.

drm/i915/bios: fix a memory leak in generate_lfp_data_ptrs

When (size != 0 || ptrs->lvds_ entries != 3), the program tries to
free() the ptrs. However, the ptrs is not created by calling kzmalloc(),
but is obtained by pointer offset operation.
This may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior.

Fix this by replacing the arguments of kfree() with ptrs_block.

CVE-2022-50288,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

qlcnic: prevent ->dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure

adapter->dcb would get silently freed inside qlcnic_dcb_enable() in
case qlcnic_dcb_attach() would return an error, which always happens
under OOM conditions. This would lead to use-after-free because both
of the existing callers invoke qlcnic_dcb_get_info() on the obtained
pointer, which is potentially freed at that point.

Propagate errors from qlcnic_dcb_enable(), and instead free the dcb
pointer at callsite using qlcnic_dcb_free(). This also removes the now
unused qlcnic_clear_dcb_ops() helper, which was a simple wrapper around
kfree() also causing memory leaks for partially initialized dcb.

drm/msm/dp: fix bridge lifetime

Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.

This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device
when binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the
resources is made.

For the DP bridges, previously allocated bridges will leak on probe
deferral.

Fix this by amending the DP parser interface and tying the lifetime of
the bridge device to the DRM device rather than DP platform device.

btrfs: do not BUG_ON() on ENOMEM when dropping extent items for a range

If we get -ENOMEM while dropping file extent items in a given range, at
btrfs_drop_extents(), due to failure to allocate memory when attempting to
increment the reference count for an extent or drop the reference count,
we handle it with a BUG_ON(). This is excessive, instead we can simply
abort the transaction and return the error to the caller. In fact most
callers of btrfs_drop_extents(), directly or indirectly, already abort
the transaction if btrfs_drop_extents() returns any error.

Also, we already have error paths at btrfs_drop_extents() that may return
-ENOMEM and in those cases we abort the transaction, like for example
anything that changes the b+tree may return -ENOMEM due to a failure to
allocate a new extent buffer when COWing an existing extent buffer, such
as a call to btrfs_duplicate_item() for example.

So replace the BUG_ON() calls with proper logic to abort the transaction

s390/cio: fix out-of-bounds access on cio_ignore free

The channel-subsystem-driver scans for newly available devices whenever
device-IDs are removed from the cio_ignore list using a command such as:

  echo free >/proc/cio_ignore

Since an I/O device scan might interfer with running I/Os, commit
172da89ed0ea (""s390/cio: avoid excessive path-verification requests"")
introduced an optimization to exclude online devices from the scan.

The newly added check for online devices incorrectly assumes that
an I/O-subchannel's drvdata points to a struct io_subchannel_private.
For devices that are bound to a non-default I/O subchannel driver, such
as the vfio_ccw driver, this results in an out-of-bounds read access
during each scan.

Fix this by changing the scan logic to rely on a driver-independent
online indication. For this we can use struct subchannel->config.ena,
which is the driver's requested subchannel-enabled state. Since I/Os
can only be started on enabled subchannels, this matches the intent
of the original optimization of not scanning devices where I/O might
be running.",unknown

nbd: Fix hung when signal interrupts nbd_start_device_ioctl()

This happens because sata_pmp_init_links() initialize link->pmp up to
SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS while em_priv is declared as 8 elements array.

I can't find the maximum Enclosure Management ports specified in AHCI
spec v1.3.1, but ""12.2.1 LED message type"" states that ""Port Multiplier
Information"" can utilize 4 bits, which implies it can support up to 16
ports. Hence, use SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS as EM_MAX_SLOTS to resolve the
issue.

pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,

======================================================

According to commit ""vfs: parse: deal with zero length string value"",
kernel will set the param->string to null pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string()
if fs string has zero length.

Yet the problem is that, hugetlbfs_parse_param() will dereference the
param->string, without checking whether it is a null pointer.  To be more
specific, if hugetlbfs_parse_param() parses an illegal mount parameter,
such as ""size=,"", kernel will constructs struct fs_parameter with null
pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string(), then passes this struct fs_parameter to
hugetlbfs_parse_param(), which triggers the above null-ptr-deref bug.

This patch solves it by adding sanity check on param->string
in hugetlbfs_parse_param().",unknown

9p: set req refcount to zero to avoid uninitialized usage

When a new request is allocated, the refcount will be zero if it is
reused, but if the request is newly allocated from slab, it is not fully
initialized before being added to idr.

use a uninitialized req, which will result in a bad request data struct.

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: clean up skbs if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails

Syzkaller detected a memory leak of skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().
While processing skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(), the already allocated
skbs in skb_pool are not freed if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails. If we
have an incorrect pkt_len or pkt_tag, the input skb is considered invalid
and dropped. All the associated packets already in skb_pool should be
dropped and freed. Added a comment describing this issue.

The patch also makes remain_skb NULL after being processed so that it
cannot be referenced after potential free. The initialization of hif_dev
fields which are associated with remain_skb (rx_remain_len,
rx_transfer_len and rx_pad_len) is moved after a new remain_skb is

Further investigation shows that the warning is superfluous, the migration
disabled task is just going to be migrated to its current running CPU.
This is because that on load balance if the dst_cpu is not allowed by the
task, we'll re-select a new_dst_cpu as a candidate. If no task can be
balanced to dst_cpu we'll try to balance the task to the new_dst_cpu
instead. In this case when the migration disabled task is not on CPU it
only allows to run on its current CPU, load balance will select its
current CPU as new_dst_cpu and later triggers the warning above.

The new_dst_cpu is chosen from the env->dst_grpmask. Currently it
contains CPUs in sched_group_span() and if we have overlapped groups it's
possible to run into this case. This patch makes env->dst_grpmask of
group_balance_mask() which exclude any CPUs from the busiest group and
solve the issue. For balancing in a domain with no overlapped groups
the behaviour keeps same as before.",unknown

rxrpc: Make it so that a waiting process can be aborted

When sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues it to wait for a connection
and channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start shovelling
data as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the
connection parameters.

However, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned
and further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is
made.

Fix this so that the call can at least be aborted without failing on
EBUSY.  We have to be careful here as sendmsg() mustn't be allowed to start
the call timer if the call doesn't yet have a connection assigned as an
oops may follow shortly thereafter.",unknown

bpf: Fix memleak due to fentry attach failure

If it fails to attach fentry, the allocated bpf trampoline image will be

In jfs_dmap.c at line 381, BLKTODMAP is used to get a logical block

ext4: Fix function prototype mismatch for ext4_feat_ktype

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.

ext4_feat_ktype was setting the ""release"" handler to ""kfree"", which
doesn't have a matching function prototype. Add a simple wrapper
with the correct prototype.

This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict
flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,
which only checks for type width mismatches.

Note that this code is only reached when ext4 is a loadable module and

erofs: Fix detection of atomic context

Current check for atomic context is not sufficient as
z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio can be called under rcu lock
from blk_mq_flush_plug_list(). See the stacktrace [1]

In such case we should hand off the decompression work for async
processing rather than trying to do sync decompression in current
context. Patch fixes the detection by checking for
rcu_read_lock_any_held() and while at it use more appropriate
!in_task() check than in_atomic().

Background: Historically erofs would always schedule a kworker for
decompression which would incur the scheduling cost regardless of
the context. But z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio() may not always
be in atomic context and we could actually benefit from doing the
decompression in z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio() if we are in
thread context, for example when running with dm-verity.
This optimization was later added in patch [2] which has shown
improvement in performance benchmarks.

drm/tests: helpers: Avoid a driver uaf

when using __drm_kunit_helper_alloc_drm_device() the driver may be
dereferenced by device-managed resources up until the device is
freed, which is typically later than the kunit-managed resource code
frees it. Fix this by simply make the driver device-managed as well.

In short, the sequence leading to the UAF is as follows:

INIT:
Code allocates a struct device as a kunit-managed resource.
Code allocates a drm driver as a kunit-managed resource.
Code allocates a drm device as a device-managed resource.

EXIT:
Kunit resource cleanup frees the drm driver
Kunit resource cleanup puts the struct device, which starts a
      device-managed resource cleanup
device-managed cleanup calls drm_dev_put()
drm_dev_put() dereferences the (now freed) drm driver -> Boom.

xsk: check IFF_UP earlier in Tx path

Xsk Tx can be triggered via either sendmsg() or poll() syscalls. These
two paths share a call to common function xsk_xmit() which has two
sanity checks within. A pseudo code example to show the two paths:

__xsk_sendmsg() :                       xsk_poll():
if (unlikely(!xsk_is_bound(xs)))        if (unlikely(!xsk_is_bound(xs)))

xsk_xmit():
if (unlikely(!(xs->dev->flags & IFF_UP)))

Have the compound processing engine always call op_release, even when

CVE-2023-53243,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: add handling for RAID1C23/DUP to btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile

Callers of `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` expect it to return exactly
one allocation profile flag, and failing to do so may ultimately
result in a WARN_ON and remount-ro when allocating new blocks, like
the below transaction abort on 6.1.

`btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` has two ways of determining the profile,
first it checks if a conversion balance is currently running and
uses the profile we're converting to. If no balance is currently
running, it returns the max-redundancy profile which at least one
block in the selected block group has.

This works by simply checking each known allocation profile bit in
redundancy order. However, `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` has not been
updated as new flags have been added - first with the `DUP` profile
and later with the RAID1C34 profiles.

Because of the way it checks, if we have blocks with different
profiles and at least one is known, that profile will be selected.
However, if none are known we may return a flag set with multiple
allocation profiles set.

This is currently only possible when a balance from one of the three
unhandled profiles to another of the unhandled profiles is canceled
after allocating at least one block using the new profile.

In that case, a transaction abort like the below will occur and the
filesystem will need to be mounted with -o skip_balance to get it
mounted rw again (but the balance cannot be resumed without a
similar abort).

media: pci: tw68: Fix null-ptr-deref bug in buf prepare and finish

When the driver calls tw68_risc_buffer() to prepare the buffer, the
function call dma_alloc_coherent may fail, resulting in a empty buffer
buf->cpu. Later when we free the buffer or access the buffer, null ptr
deref is triggered.

This bug is similar to the following one:
https://git.linuxtv.org/media_stage.git/commit/?id=2b064d91440b33fba5b452f2d1b31f13ae911d71.

We believe the bug can be also dynamically triggered from user side.
Similarly, we fix this by checking the return value of tw68_risc_buffer()
and the value of buf->cpu before buffer free.",unknown
CVE-2023-53245,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts

Hyper-V provides the ability to connect Fibre Channel LUNs to the host
system and present them in a guest VM as a SCSI device. I/O to the vFC
device is handled by the storvsc driver. The storvsc driver includes a
partial integration with the FC transport implemented in the generic
portion of the Linux SCSI subsystem so that FC attributes can be displayed
in /sys.  However, the partial integration means that some aspects of vFC
don't work properly. Unfortunately, a full and correct integration isn't
practical because of limitations in what Hyper-V provides to the guest.

In particular, in the context of Hyper-V storvsc, the FC transport timeout
function fc_eh_timed_out() causes a kernel panic because it can't find the
rport and dereferences a NULL pointer. The original patch that added the
call from storvsc_eh_timed_out() to fc_eh_timed_out() is faulty in this
regard.

In many cases a timeout is due to a transient condition, so the situation
can be improved by just continuing to wait like with other I/O requests
issued by storvsc, and avoiding the guaranteed panic. For a permanent
failure, continuing to wait may result in a hung thread instead of a panic,
which again may be better.

So fix the panic by removing the storvsc call to fc_eh_timed_out().  This
allows storvsc to keep waiting for a response.  The change has been tested
by users who experienced a panic in fc_eh_timed_out() due to transient
timeouts, and it solves their problem.

In the future we may want to deprecate the vFC functionality in storvsc
since it can't be fully fixed. But it has current users for whom it is
working well enough, so it should probably stay for a while longer.",unknown

This happens because during btrfs_cont_expand we'll get a page, set it
as mapped, and if it's not Uptodate we'll read it.  However between the
read and re-locking the page we could have called release_folio() on the
page, but left the page in the file mapping.  release_folio() can clear
the page private, and thus further down we blow up when we go to modify
the subpage bits.

Fix this by putting the set_page_extent_mapped() after the read.  This
is safe because read_folio() will call set_page_extent_mapped() before
it does the read, and then if we clear page private but leave it on the
mapping we're completely safe re-setting set_page_extent_mapped().  With
this patch I can now run generic/476 without panicing.",unknown

Bluetooth: use RCU for hci_conn_params and iterate safely in hci_sync

hci_update_accept_list_sync iterates over hdev->pend_le_conns and
hdev->pend_le_reports, and waits for controller events in the loop body,
without holding hdev lock.

Meanwhile, these lists and the items may be modified e.g. by
le_scan_cleanup. This can invalidate the list cursor or any other item
in the list, resulting to invalid behavior (eg use-after-free).

Use RCU for the hci_conn_params action lists. Since the loop bodies in
hci_sync block and we cannot use RCU or hdev->lock for the whole loop,
copy list items first and then iterate on the copy. Only the flags field
is written from elsewhere, so READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE should guarantee we
read valid values.

Free params everywhere with hci_conn_params_free so the cleanup is
guaranteed to be done properly.

This fixes the following, which can be triggered e.g. by BlueZ new
mgmt-tester case ""Add + Remove Device Nowait - Success"", or by changing

However, in cases such as kdump/kexec, not all relids will be reset by the host.
When the second kernel boots and if the guest receives a vmbus interrupt during
vmbus driver initialization before vmbus_connect() is called, before it finishes,
or if it fails, the vmbus interrupt service routine is called which in turn calls
relid2channel() and can cause a null pointer dereference.

Print a warning and error out in relid2channel() for a channel id that's invalid
in the second kernel.",unknown

clk: mediatek: mt8183: Add back SSPM related clocks

This reverts commit 860690a93ef23b567f781c1b631623e27190f101.

On the MT8183, the SSPM related clocks were removed claiming a lack of
usage. This however causes some issues when the driver was converted to
the new simple-probe mechanism. This mechanism allocates enough space
for all the clocks defined in the clock driver, not the highest index
in the DT binding. This leads to out-of-bound writes if their are holes
in the DT binding or the driver (due to deprecated or unimplemented
clocks). These errors can go unnoticed and cause memory corruption,
leading to crashes in unrelated areas, or nothing at all. KASAN will
detect them.

Add the SSPM related clocks back to the MT8183 clock driver to fully
implement the DT binding. The SSPM clocks are for the power management
co-processor, and should never be turned off. They are marked as such.",unknown

ALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()

The variable codec->regmap is often protected by the lock
codec->regmap_lock when is accessed. However, it is accessed without
holding the lock when is accessed in snd_hdac_regmap_sync():

  if (codec->regmap)

In my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec->regmap is
set to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer
dereference can occur in the called function regcache_sync():

  map->lock(map->lock_arg); --> Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c

To fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the
mutex_lock coverage is extended to protect the if statement as well as the
function call to regcache_sync().

[ Note: the lack of the regmap_lock itself is harmless for the current
  codec driver implementations, as snd_hdac_regmap_sync() is only for
  PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec probe.
  But the change makes the whole code more consistent, so it's merged

When the main thread in the client starts a connection, if its out stream

another thread in the client keeps sending the msgs with stream number
N - 1, and waits for sndbuf before processing INIT_ACK.

CVE-2025-39821,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Avoid undefined behavior from stopping/starting inactive events

Calling pmu->start()/stop() on perf events in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF can
leave event->hw.idx at -1. When PMU drivers later attempt to use this
negative index as a shift exponent in bitwise operations, it leads to UBSAN
shift-out-of-bounds reports.

The issue is a logical flaw in how event groups handle throttling when some
members are intentionally disabled. Based on the analysis and the
reproducer provided by Mark Rutland (this issue on both arm64 and x86-64).

The scenario unfolds as follows:

 1. A group leader event is configured with a very aggressive sampling
    period (e.g., sample_period = 1). This causes frequent interrupts and
    triggers the throttling mechanism.
 2. A child event in the same group is created in a disabled state
    (.disabled = 1). This event remains in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF.
    Since it hasn't been scheduled onto the PMU, its event->hw.idx remains
    initialized at -1.
 3. When throttling occurs, perf_event_throttle_group() and later
    perf_event_unthrottle_group() iterate through all siblings, including
    the disabled child event.
 4. perf_event_throttle()/unthrottle() are called on this inactive child
    event, which then call event->pmu->start()/stop().
 5. The PMU driver receives the event with hw.idx == -1 and attempts to
    use it as a shift exponent. e.g., in macros like PMCNTENSET(idx),
    leading to the UBSAN report.

The throttling mechanism attempts to start/stop events that are not
actively scheduled on the hardware.

Move the state check into perf_event_throttle()/perf_event_unthrottle() so
that inactive events are skipped entirely. This ensures only active events
with a valid hw.idx are processed, preventing undefined behavior and
silencing UBSAN warnings. The corrected check ensures true before
proceeding with PMU operations.

A bit of digging showed that we were invoking the phylink_resume as a part
of the fbnic_up path when we were enabling the service task while not
holding the RTNL lock. We should be enabling this sooner as a part of the
ndo_open path and then just letting the service task come online later.
This will help to enforce the correct locking and brings the phylink
interface online at the same time as the network interface, instead of at a
later time.

I tested this on QEMU to verify this was working by putting the system to
sleep using ""echo mem > /sys/power/state"" to put the system to sleep in the
guest and then using the command ""system_wakeup"" in the QEMU monitor.",network

If the floppy_alloc_disk() failed, disks of current drive will not be set,
thus the lastest allocated set->tag cannot be freed in the error handling
path. A simple call graph shown as below:

 floppy_module_init()
   floppy_init()
     do_floppy_init()
       for (drive = 0; drive < N_DRIVE; drive++)
         blk_mq_alloc_tag_set()
           blk_mq_alloc_tag_set_tags()
             blk_mq_realloc_tag_set_tags() # set->tag allocated
         floppy_alloc_disk()
           blk_mq_alloc_disk() # error occurred, disks failed to allocated

       ->out_put_disk:
       for (drive = 0; drive < N_DRIVE; drive++)
         if (!disks[drive][0]) # the last disks is not set and loop break
           break;
         blk_mq_free_tag_set() # the latest allocated set->tag leaked

Fix this problem by free the set->tag of current drive before jump to
error handling path.

rapidio: fix possible name leaks when rio_add_device() fails

This patchset fixes three name leaks in error handling.
 - patch #1 fixes two name leaks while rio_add_device() fails.
 - patch #2 fixes a name leak while  rio_register_mport() fails.


This patch (of 2):

If rio_add_device() returns error, the name allocated by dev_set_name()
need be freed.  It should use put_device() to give up the reference in the
error path, so that the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup(), and the
'rdev' can be freed in rio_release_dev().",unknown

rbd: avoid use-after-free in do_rbd_add() when rbd_dev_create() fails

If getting an ID or setting up a work queue in rbd_dev_create() fails,
use-after-free on rbd_dev->rbd_client, rbd_dev->spec and rbd_dev->opts
is triggered in do_rbd_add().  The root cause is that the ownership of
these structures is transfered to rbd_dev prematurely and they all end
up getting freed when rbd_dev_create() calls rbd_dev_free() prior to

net: fec: Better handle pm_runtime_get() failing in .remove()

In the (unlikely) event that pm_runtime_get() (disguised as
pm_runtime_resume_and_get()) fails, the remove callback returned an
error early. The problem with this is that the driver core ignores the
error value and continues removing the device. This results in a
resource leak. Worse the devm allocated resources are freed and so if a
callback of the driver is called later the register mapping is already
gone which probably results in a crash.",unknown

CVE-2023-53310,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Fix external_power_changed race

fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() dereferences info->bat,
which gets sets in axp288_fuel_gauge_probe() like this:

  info->bat = devm_power_supply_register(dev, &fuel_gauge_desc, &psy_cfg);

As soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add()
the external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window
where fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() may get called while
info->bat has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Fixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed
the power_supply which will eventually get stored in info->bat,
so fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() can simply directly use
the passed in psy argument which is always valid.",unknown
CVE-2023-53311,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix use-after-free of nilfs_root in dirtying inodes via iput

During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after
nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  Previously,
nilfs_evict_inode() could cause use-after-free read for nilfs_root if
inodes are left in ""garbage_list"" and released by nilfs_dispose_list at
the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer(), and this bug was fixed by commit
9b5a04ac3ad9 (""nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in
nilfs_evict_inode()"").

However, it turned out that there is another possibility of UAF in the
call path where mark_inode_dirty_sync() is called from iput():

nilfs_detach_log_writer()
  nilfs_dispose_list()
    iput()
      mark_inode_dirty_sync()
        __mark_inode_dirty()
          nilfs_dirty_inode()
            __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty()
              nilfs_load_inode_block() --> causes UAF of nilfs_root struct

This can happen after commit 0ae45f63d4ef (""vfs: add support for a
lazytime mount option""), which changed iput() to call
mark_inode_dirty_sync() on its final reference if i_state has I_DIRTY_TIME
flag and i_nlink is non-zero.

This issue appears after commit 28a65b49eb53 (""nilfs2: do not write dirty
data after degenerating to read-only"") when using the syzbot reproducer,
but the issue has potentially existed before.

Fix this issue by adding a ""purging flag"" to the nilfs structure, setting
that flag while disposing the ""garbage_list"" and checking it in
__nilfs_mark_inode_dirty().

Unlike commit 9b5a04ac3ad9 (""nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root
in nilfs_evict_inode()""), this patch does not rely on ns_writer to
determine whether to skip operations, so as not to break recovery on
mount.  The nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs routine dirties the buffer of
salvaged data before attaching the log writer, so changing
__nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() to skip the operation when ns_writer is NULL
will cause recovery write to fail.  The purpose of using the cleanup-only
flag is to allow for narrowing of such conditions.",unknown

CVE-2023-53320,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Fix issues in mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info()

The function mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info() has four issues:

1) It calculates valid entry length in alltgt_info assuming the header part
   of the struct mpi3mr_device_map_info would equal to sizeof(u32).  The
   correct size is sizeof(u64).

2) When it calculates the valid entry length kern_entrylen, it excludes one
   entry by subtracting 1 from num_devices.

3) It copies num_device by calling memcpy(). Substitution is enough.

4) It does not specify the calculated length to sg_copy_from_buffer().
   Instead, it specifies the payload length which is larger than the
   alltgt_info size. It causes ""BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds"".

Fix the issues by using the correct header size, removing the subtraction
from num_devices, replacing the memcpy() with substitution and specifying
the correct length to sg_copy_from_buffer().",unknown
CVE-2025-59414,"Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Prior to 3.19.0 and 4.1.0, A client-side path traversal vulnerability in Nuxt's Island payload revival mechanism allowed attackers to manipulate client-side requests to different endpoints within the same application domain when specific prerendering conditions are met. The vulnerability occurs in the client-side payload revival process (revive-payload.client.ts) where Nuxt Islands are automatically fetched when encountering serialized __nuxt_island objects. During prerendering, if an API endpoint returns user-controlled data containing a crafted __nuxt_island object, he data gets serialized with devalue.stringify and stored in the prerendered page. When a client navigates to the prerendered page, devalue.parse deserializes the payload. The Island reviver attempts to fetch /__nuxt_island/${key}.json where key could contain path traversal sequences. Update to Nuxt 3.19.0+ or 4.1.0+.",unknown

CVE-2025-61925,"Astro is a web framework. Prior to version 5.14.2, Astro reflects the value in `X-Forwarded-Host` in output when using `Astro.url` without any validation. It is common for web servers such as nginx to route requests via the `Host` header, and forward on other request headers. As such as malicious request can be sent with both a `Host` header and an `X-Forwarded-Host` header where the values do not match and the `X-Forwarded-Host` header is malicious. Astro will then return the malicious value. This could result in any usages of the `Astro.url` value in code being manipulated by a request. For example if a user follows guidance and uses `Astro.url` for a canonical link the canonical link can be manipulated to another site. It is theoretically possible that the value could also be used as a login/registration or other form URL as well, resulting in potential redirecting of login credentials to a malicious party. As this is a per-request attack vector the surface area would only be to the malicious user until one considers that having a caching proxy is a common setup, in which case any page which is cached could persist the malicious value for subsequent users. Many other frameworks have an allowlist of domains to validate against, or do not have a case where the headers are reflected to avoid such issues. This could affect anyone using Astro in an on-demand/dynamic rendering mode behind a caching proxy. Version 5.14.2 contains a fix for the issue.",unknown

However, `escape_mode=1` computes without performing adequate logic to ensure a fully escaped return value.

Kernel panics because it detects UFFD inconsistency during
userfaultfd_release_all().  Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer
to vma->vm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma->vm_flags.

The inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise()
with MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode,
it accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of
vma->vm_flags.

Assuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and
int are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the &=
~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.

VM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. 
After ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then
promoted to unsigned long before the & operation.  This promotion fills
upper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and
even for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).
& operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff
instead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears
the upper 32-bits of its value.

Fix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the
BIT() macro.

Note: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the
VM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int
and after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted
to unsigned long with leading 1s.

Note 2:
After commit 31defc3b01d9 (""userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s""), this is
no longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:

[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067

In these cases, only users who authenticate via the Enterprise SSO IdP (e.g. Okta) would be able to exploit this vulnerability to access the member list, i.e. internal users getting access to a list of other internal users.

CVE-2025-64717,"ZITADEL is an open source identity management platform. Starting in version 2.50.0 and prior to versions 2.71.19, 3.4.4, and 4.6.6, a vulnerability in ZITADEL's federation process allowed auto-linking users from external identity providers to existing users in ZITADEL even if the corresponding IdP was not active or if the organization did not allow federated authentication. This vulnerability stems from the platform's failure to correctly check or enforce an organization's specific security settings during the authentication flow. An Organization Administrator can explicitly disable an IdP or disallow federation, but this setting was not being honored during the auto-linking process. This allowed an unauthenticated attacker to initiate a login using an IdP that should have been disabled for that organization. The platform would incorrectly validate the login and, based on a matching criteria, link the attacker's external identity to an existing internal user account. This may result in a full Account Takeover, bypassing the organization's mandated security controls. Note that accounts with MFA enabled can not be taken over by this attack. Also note that only IdPs create on an instance level would allow this to work. IdPs registered on another organization would always be denied in the (auto-)linking process. Versions 4.6.6, 3.4.4, and 2.71.19 resolve the issue by correctly validating the organization's login policy before auto-linking an external user.

ACPI: video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()

during device removal.

If the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight()
frees these resources, it causes a use-after-free when

Fix this by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for each device's
